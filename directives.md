Full-Stack PWA Tech Stack (iOS-Optimized)
ðŸ›  Tech Stack
Frontend

Next.js 14+ (React framework)

Built-in PWA support via next-pwa plugin
Server-side rendering for better performance
App Router for modern routing
API routes for backend (eliminates separate backend server)


Tailwind CSS for styling

Utility-first, mobile-responsive by default
Easy to make iOS-native-looking UI


PWA Configuration

Service Worker (via next-pwa)
Web App Manifest
Offline support



Backend

Next.js API Routes (built into Next.js)

/app/api/ folder structure
Serverless functions
No separate Express server needed



Database

PostgreSQL via Vercel Postgres or Neon

Relational, scalable, free tier available
Direct integration with Vercel deployment


Prisma ORM

Type-safe database queries
Easy migrations
Works seamlessly with PostgreSQL



Hosting (All-in-One)

Vercel (recommended)

Deploys Next.js frontend + API routes + database
Automatic HTTPS
Global CDN
Zero-config deployment
Free tier generous for side projects



Alternative: Railway or Render (if you need more backend control)

ðŸŽ¯ Goals (In Order)

Set up Next.js project with PWA configuration

Install Next.js, configure next-pwa, create manifest.json
Add iOS-specific meta tags and icons (180Ã—180 apple-touch-icon)


Create the core UI (iOS-native look)

Build mobile-first responsive layouts with Tailwind
Use iOS design patterns (bottom tab navigation, cards, system fonts)
Test on iPhone Safari during development


Set up Prisma + PostgreSQL

Initialize Prisma, define schema
Create migrations, seed initial data
Connect to Vercel Postgres or Neon database


Build API routes (backend logic)

Create /app/api/ endpoints for CRUD operations
Implement authentication (NextAuth.js recommended)
Connect API routes to Prisma/database


Implement offline functionality

Configure service worker caching strategies
Create offline fallback pages
Cache static assets and API responses intelligently


Deploy to Vercel

Connect GitHub repo to Vercel
Configure environment variables (database URL, secrets)
Deploy and test on production URL


Test PWA installation on iPhone

Open Safari â†’ Share â†’ Add to Home Screen
Verify standalone mode, splash screen, icons
Test offline functionality


Optimize & audit

Run Lighthouse PWA audit
Optimize images (use Next.js <Image>)
Fine-tune caching strategies




ðŸ’¡ Things to Remember / Themes
iOS-First Design

iOS Safari is your primary target browser
Use display: "standalone" in manifest to hide browser chrome
Test frequently on actual iPhone (not just simulator)
iOS requires manual "Add to Home Screen" (no install prompt like Android)

PWA Essentials

HTTPS is mandatory (Vercel provides this automatically)
Service Worker must be registered properly
Manifest.json must be linked in <head>
Provide multiple icon sizes (192, 512, and apple-touch-icon 180Ã—180)

All-in-One Deployment

Keep everything in one Next.js monorepo
Use API routes instead of separate backend server
Database connection string goes in .env.local (never commit!)
Vercel automatically deploys on git push

Offline-First Mindset

Cache static assets aggressively (cache-first)
Use network-first for dynamic data
Always provide offline fallback UI
Test with DevTools Network throttling

Mobile Performance

Lazy-load images and components
Minimize JavaScript bundle size
Use Next.js Image optimization
Test on slow 3G connections

Developer Experience

Use TypeScript for type safety (Next.js supports it out of box)
Prisma gives you autocomplete for database queries
localhost:3000 allows service workers without HTTPS during dev
Hot reload works with Next.js dev server

iOS Limitations to Remember

No background sync (limited compared to Android)
Web Push notifications require iOS 16.4+ and Home Screen install
Some PWA APIs still lag behind Android
Splash screens may need custom meta tags


ðŸ“¦ Quick Start Commands
bash# Create Next.js app
npx create-next-app@latest my-pwa-app --typescript --tailwind --app

# Install PWA plugin
npm install next-pwa

# Install Prisma
npm install prisma @prisma/client
npx prisma init

# Run dev server
npm run dev

Bottom line: This stack lets you build a single codebase that deploys as one unit to Vercel, with front-end, back-end, and database all managed together. It'll look and feel like a native iOS app when installed, while being a web app under the hood. Perfect for side projects or MVPs that need to move fast without managing separate servers.
